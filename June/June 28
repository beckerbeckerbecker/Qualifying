Henri Eugène Padé.
A Padé approximant is the "best" approximation of a function by a rational function of given order -- under this technique, the approximant's power series agrees with the power series of the function it is approximating. The technique was developed around 1890 by the French mathematician Henri Padé (1863--1953), but goes back to the German mathematician Georg Frobenius (1849--1917) who introduced the idea and investigated the features of rational approximations of power series. Henri Eugène Padé, while preparing his doctorate under Charles Hermite, he introduced what is now known as the Padé approximant.
